"""
DUNE plot style tools: provides tools for making plots adhere to DUNE style.

Contains two independent implementations: one for PyROOT (dunestyle.root) and one for matplotlib (dunestyle.matplotlib).
We suggest importing the one you prefer like:
  from dunestyle import matplotlib as dunestyle

Then all of the relevant functions will be exposed as `dunestyle.____`.
